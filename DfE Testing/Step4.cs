    // Some basic requirements
    // needs a way for customers to report a problem e.g a pothole in the road, flytipping, litter etc
    // service for recording the report

    // the report needs to go into the councils CRM system

    // need a way to update the customer with a CRM ref number via text / email
    // and maybe on the outcome of their report (this would be very useful for when a councillor reports a problem as they like to know what's happening
